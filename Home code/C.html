                <li>The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that provides low-level access to system memory. 
                 A program written in C must be run through a C compiler to convert it into an executable that a computer can run. Many 
                 versions of Unix-based operating systems (OSes) are written in C and it has been standardized as part of the Portable
                 Operating System Interface (POSIX).
                                                     Today, the C programming language runs on many different hardware platforms and OSes 
                 such as Microsoft and Linux.</li>
