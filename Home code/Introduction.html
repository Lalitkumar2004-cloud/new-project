    <h3>introduction</h3>
     <p>Coding is telling a computer what to do, in a way that, with a bit of translation, it can understand.

        You give computers instructions in what is known as 'code', in a similar way to how you might have a recipe for how to cook something. You tell the computer about elements it needs to work with (like the ingredients), you give it instructions, and there might be some conditions it needs to choose between (like choosing whether an oven is electric or gas and then following the corresponding temperature).
        
        These instructions you give the computer need to be broken down into every single task, without ambiguity. It can take practice to think as a computer would so you can work out what instructions would need to be written.
        
        Exercises
        So how do you give computers instructions they can follow? This exercise is designed to get you thinking more like a computer - by telling a computer how to boil a kettle!
        
        Make a copy of the slide deck below, read the instructions on the first slide, and use the second slide to rearrange the flow chart into an order you think a computer could follow.

        Talking to computers  
        So, you're giving the computer instructions - but how? The computer doesn't understand our words, or our flowcharts, so what do we do?
        
        That's where the code part comes in. Different coding languages (or programming languages) are how you write the instructions in a way that the computer can interpret them.
        
        Like other languages, these have their own vocabulary and syntax and each one is a bit different, but they have a lot of similarities, including key features that we explore elsewhere on this page.
        
        Binary which translates to 'Hello computer'
        Even using coding languages, the computer cannot understand what you're saying. The instructions still don't mean something that the computer can do yet. Instead, the coding language must be translated into binary (on or off, 1 or 0) for the computer to follow it.
        
        This means that your code, written as text, must be translated, often by a tool called a compiler, for it to 'run' and the computer to follow your instructions. You often need to download a program that will allow you to run the code you've written, or you might write your code in a specific piece of software designed both to help you write code and to run it for you. These can be called coding environments.
