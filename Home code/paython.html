            <ul>
                <li>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in
                     data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,
                      as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn 
                      syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, 
                      which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available
                       in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</li>
