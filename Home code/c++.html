               <ul>
                <li>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale 
                    applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.</li>
                    <li>
                    A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such 
                    as the internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages 
                    over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study.</li>
                    <li>
                    C++ allows software developers to define their own data types and manipulate them using functions and methods. It also allows 
                    low-level programming and provides access to memory, enabling fast and efficient execution of code. It also supports generic 
                    programming using templates, which let code be written in a generic form and reused for different data types.</li>
                    <li>
                    C++ is used in fields such as system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing and high-performance
                    applications. The C++ standard library provides a range of coding utilities and functions, making it easy to develop complex
                    software systems. C++ can run on many platforms, including Linux, Mac and Windows.</li>
